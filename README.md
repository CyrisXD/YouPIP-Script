# YouPIP - YouTube Picture-in-Picture Auto Toggle (GreaseMonkey / TamperMonkey Script)

This script enables YouTube videos to automatically enter Picture-in-Picture mode when switching tabs, allowing users to continue watching the video while browsing other websites. The video will exit Picture-in-Picture mode and resume playback in the original browser window when the user returns to the YouTube tab. The script only activates Picture-in-Picture mode if the video is currently playing.

## Installation

1. Install the GreaseMonkey browser extension:

   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
   - [Chrome](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Tampermonkey is an alternative to GreaseMonkey for Chrome users)

2. Click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyrisXD/YouPIP-Script/main/youPIP.user.js) to install the YouTube Picture-in-Picture Toggle script.

3. GreaseMonkey should automatically detect the script and prompt you to install it. Click "Install" to proceed.

## Usage

Once the script is installed, simply watch a YouTube video and switch to another tab. If the video is playing, it will automatically enter Picture-in-Picture mode. Switch back to the YouTube tab to exit Picture-in-Picture mode and resume playback in the original browser window.
